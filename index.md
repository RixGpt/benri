# Welcome to Benri

We're a group of developers, using AI for good. We build simple, helpful tools for people like you. All free, no catches.

## Tools For You:

- Benri tracks the cost of everyday essentials — food, fuel, shelter, and soap — with a cheeky little chart we call the **Bare Necessities Index**. This site is a home for that chart, our commentary, and any tools we build around it.
